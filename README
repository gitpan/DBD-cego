Requirements
-----------
To build the Cego DBD driver, you need the following library packages available from www.lemke-it.com:
   
   lfc-1.1.34.tar.gz
   lfcxml-1.0.23.tar.gz
   cego-2.6.14.tar.gz ( client library )	

Tested platforms and compliers
----------------------------
Cego DBD is pretty new and has just been tested on Mac OS X and Solaris x86
using  GNU C++ compiler

Please note: Cego DBD uses the XS API in combination with C++ libraries.
There are still expected some problems with different platforms.

Installation
------------
Run the configure script with the following options

    $ perl Makefile.PL --prefix=<prefix-dir>

where prefix-dir is the base directory of the previous installed base, 
xml and Cego client header files and libraries ( e.g. /usr/local ).

Run make

    $ make

This builds the complete DBD driver. 

To test the driver, you first have to build up a cego database and start up the daemon.
Edit the connection parameter file dbd.def and put in the appropriate database connection parameters
in the first line.

The following format ist required

<hostname>:<port>:<tableset>:<user>:<password>

( e.g. geek:2200:TS1:lemke:lemke )

Now you can run the database driver tests with

    $ make test

If succesful, deliver the package with

    $ make install

For more information about how to use Cego DBD, please refer to the HTML-based
documentation on www.lemke-it.com

Have fun !
